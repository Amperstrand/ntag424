/// Most authenticated commands consume `self` and return it only on success.
/// On the PICC, successful authenticated-session commands advance the shared
/// `CmdCtr`, including commands sent with plain wire framing. MAC-protected
/// and encrypted commands additionally derive or verify secure-messaging data
/// from the current counter value. If a command fails, the host cannot in
/// general know whether the PICC already advanced its counter, so continuing
/// to use the old session could desynchronise secure messaging.
///
/// Taking ownership of the session makes this explicit: on error the caller
/// loses the session and must re-authenticate.
///
/// The plain authenticated helpers [`Self::read_file_plain`] and
/// [`Self::write_file_plain`] take `&mut self` instead because the APDU
/// framing itself is plain: no request or response MAC is computed or
/// verified. A successful call still advances the tracked counter so the
